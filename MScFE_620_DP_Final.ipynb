Although it does not possess intrinsic value at this moment, it holds time value and potential upside as the expiration date approaches. The Black-Scholes model, as applied here, accounts for factors such as the stock price relative to the strike price, a short time to expiration ($T = 0.25$ years), a moderate volatility ($\\sigma = 20\\%$), and a risk-free rate ($r = 5\\%$) (Hull, 2018).\n",

The Black-Scholes model suggests this relatively low premium due to the short time to maturity and moderate volatility, indicating the put option is primarily valued for its potential as a hedge against downside risk (McDonald, 2013).\n"

        "**Put Option:-** Here too the put option's price and Delta indicate an at-the-money status and not deeply \"out of the money.\" This moderate negative Delta (-0.43) reflects that the put option’s price will decrease moderately as the stock price increases. Here the Vega will shows a similar moderate sensitivity to volatility which is indicating that the put option will gain value as volatility rises and this is  making it useful for hedging against potential downside risks in volatile markets.\n",

This makes sense for put options because they become more valuable as the stock price decreases. A positive Delta ( rare and unusual for put options) would imply the option price increases when the stock price increases, which is not the usual behavior for put options. For an American put option, you would expect the Delta to be negative. The reason is that as the stock price increases, the intrinsic value of the put (the benefit from exercising early) diminishes, leading to a decrease in its overall value. on the otherhand, if the stock price drops, the potential for profit from the put option increases, making it more valuable.\n",

The strategies formulated will ensure that each portfolio remains minimally affected by small price changes in the underlying asset.\n",

Such and thes strategies are fundamental in managing exposure in options trading and are consistent with standard options pricing and hedging models (Black & Scholes, 1973; Hull, 2018).\n"
