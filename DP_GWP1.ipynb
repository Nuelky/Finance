Hence one would benefit from an increase in the stock's price. Also, For a put option, a negative delta is logical, this is because as the stock price increases, the value of the put option which is right to sell decreases. If the stock's price is high, the value of having an option to sell it at a lower price goes down. This relationship between option values and stock price movements is very important in understanding the hedging and risk management of options."

Vega is positive for both calls and puts, meaning that both option types benefit from an increase in volatility. This is because the more volatile the stock, the higher the probability that it could make a large move either upward or downward. Although both option types benefit from increased volatility, the exact magnitude of the increase might be different for calls and puts.

        "Early exercise will introduce complexity into the hedging process which in turn requires larger adjustments to maintain the Delta-neutral position.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result the rapid changes in Delta will require more frequent and substantial adjustments in the number of shares held which inturns leads to larger swings in the cash account and in our case which increased from -6.07 to 95.71 over three steps.\n",

        "Without the early exercise the Delta for the European put option will follow a more gradual path as the stock price moves which will be requiring fewer sharp adjustments in the hedging position.\n",
